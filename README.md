# ASCII Art Web Export File

## Overview

The ASCII Art Web Export File project is an extension of the ASCII Art Web application. This project allows users to generate ASCII art from text input on a web interface and export the generated ASCII art as a downloadable file. The project focuses on implementing file export functionality with proper HTTP headers and permissions, ensuring the file can be exported in the desired format with the correct settings.

## Objectives

- **File Export:** Ensure that users can export the ASCII art generated by the web application in at least one export format of your choice (e.g., `.txt`).
- **File Permissions:** The exported file must have the correct read and write permissions for the user.
- **HTTP Headers:** Utilize appropriate HTTP headers (`Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Disposition`) when sending the file as part of the HTTP response.
- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for the web server, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Good Practices:** Ensure the code follows best practices in Go programming and web development.

## Features

- **ASCII Art Generation:** Users can enter text on the website to generate ASCII art in various styles.
- **Export to File:** A new HTTP endpoint allows users to export the generated ASCII art as a downloadable file with appropriate HTTP headers.
- **Responsive Design:** The web interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling is implemented to manage user input and server issues.

## Implementation Details

- **Web Server:** The web server is implemented in Go, using only standard Go packages.
- **Export Format:** The application supports exporting the ASCII art as a `.txt` file.
- **HTTP Headers:** The server correctly sets `Content-Type`, `Content-Length`, and `Content-Disposition` headers for file export.
- **Permissions:** The exported file is created with the correct read and write permissions for the user.
